# Aerospacemodel Code of Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, the Aerospacemodel team and community includes professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on all aspects of the mission — including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity is one of our strengths. It can also create communication challenges. This Code of Conduct sets shared expectations to help maintain a respectful, productive, and inclusive community.

This code applies equally to founders, maintainers, contributors, mentors, and people seeking help or guidance.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Aerospacemodel project, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Chat channels and mailing lists
- Events, workshops, and calls
- Any other project-managed communication forums

Unacceptable behavior outside these spaces may also affect a person’s ability to participate in project spaces when it impacts community safety or trust.

## Our Standards

### Expected behavior

- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be welcoming.**  
  We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, family status, political belief, religion, and mental or physical ability.
- **Be considerate.**  
  Your decisions and communications affect users and collaborators. Consider impact, and remember this is a global community where many participants are not communicating in their first language.
- **Be respectful.**  
  Disagreement is normal; disrespect is not. Personal attacks, intimidation, and hostile conduct are incompatible with a productive technical community.
- **Choose words carefully.**  
  We are professionals. Be constructive, precise, and kind.
- **When we disagree, seek understanding.**  
  Different viewpoints are expected. Focus on resolving issues and learning, not blaming.

### Unacceptable behavior

The following behaviors are not acceptable, including in technical disagreements:

- Violent threats or language directed at another person
- Discriminatory jokes, slurs, or demeaning language
- Sexually explicit or violent content posted in community spaces
- Posting or threatening to post someone’s personal information (“doxing”)
- Personal insults, including racist or sexist insults
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior
- Repeated harassment of others
- Continuing behavior after being asked to stop

## Reporting

If you believe someone is violating this Code of Conduct, report it to:

- **Email:** `<conduct@aerospacemodel.com>`

Please include as much relevant detail as possible (context, links, timestamps, screenshots if available).

All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled as confidentially as possible. Retaliation against anyone who reports in good faith is prohibited.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. They may take any action deemed appropriate to protect the community, including:

- Private warning
- Temporary suspension from project spaces
- Permanent removal from project spaces
- Escalation to platform moderators where required

Enforcement decisions prioritize community safety, fairness, and documentation of actions taken.
