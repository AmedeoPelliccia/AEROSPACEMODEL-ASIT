| Reference | Date | What It Covers | What It Does NOT Cover (AQUA-V Gap) | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Digital twins in aerospace** ([Nature 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00613-8)) | 2024 | DT synchronisation from sensor and simulation data; data provenance; physics-based fidelity levels | Quantum evidence record provenance; governance-gated updates; human approval for safety-critical state changes; SSOT coupling | Medium |
| **Airbus Digital Twins** ([Airbus 2025](https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/stories/2025-04-digital-twins-accelerating-aerospace-innovation-from-design-to-operations)) | 2025 | Airbus DT operational deployment; design-to-operations continuity | Quantum-assisted update cycle; cryptographic evidence provenance; governance-gated transitions; GAIA-X data sovereignty | Medium |
| **Autodesk Certification-Ready DT** ([Autodesk Research](https://www.research.autodesk.com/publications/certification-ready-design-digital-twin-high-performance-engineering/)) | 2023 | Certification-ready design; simulation traceability | Quantum computation provenance; governance-gated DT updates; fidelity level management with quantum source | **High** |
| **Siemens Xcelerator Digital Thread** ([Siemens 2024](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com)) | 2024 | Digital thread in PLM; design-to-manufacturing continuity | Quantum computation provenance; cryptographic binding; safety criticality gating | Low |
| **GAIA-X data sovereignty framework** ([GAIA-X 2022](https://gaia-x.eu)) | 2022 | EU data sovereignty; federated data infrastructure; data space contracts | Not prior art to the invention; motivates Claim 4 (GAIA-X hosting requirement) | Low |

## Gap Analysis

No reference addresses **governance-gated DT state transitions with quantum computation provenance**. The Autodesk reference is closest (certification-ready design DT) but uses classical simulation only and has no governance gate.
