| Reference | Date | What It Covers | What It Does NOT Cover (AQUA-V Gap) | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DO-178C Tool Qualification Records** (RTCA, 2011) | 2011 | Software tool qualification; TQR format; independence requirements | Quantum computation tools; DER-based evidence; automated traceability from quantum results to certification objectives; eIDAS-qualified packaging | Low |
| **ARP4754A System Development** (SAE, 2010) | 2010 | Design justification packages; process assurance levels; traceability | Quantum-specific evidence records; automated mapping from quantum computation to ARP4754A process activities | Low |
| **Autodesk Certification-Ready Digital Twin** ([Autodesk Research](https://www.research.autodesk.com/publications/certification-ready-design-digital-twin-high-performance-engineering/)) | 2023 | Certification-ready design artefacts; simulation traceability; design documentation | Quantum computation evidence; DER retrieval and packaging; eIDAS-qualified submission | **High** |
| **eIDAS Regulation (EU No 910/2014)** ([EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910)) | 2014 | Qualified electronic signatures; trust service providers; QSCD requirements | Patent claims scope — referenced as the applicable standard, not prior art to the invention | Low |
| **EASA Part 21 DOA documentation** ([EASA AMC 21.A.239](https://www.easa.europa.eu)) | 2020 | Design Organisation Approval documentation requirements; compliance demonstration | Quantum computation evidence packaging; automated generation from DERs | Low |
| **Digital twins in aerospace** ([Nature 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00613-8)) | 2024 | Data provenance in aerospace digital twins; certification readiness | Quantum computation specific evidence; DER aggregation; eIDAS-qualified submission | Low |
