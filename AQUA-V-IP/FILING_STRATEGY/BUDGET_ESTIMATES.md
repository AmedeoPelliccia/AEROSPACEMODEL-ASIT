## Annual Renewal Fees (Post-Grant)

### Unitary Patent (EPO — single EU fee)

| Year | Annual Fee (EUR) | Notes |
|---|---|---|

## Cost Optimisation Options (Preserving EU Primacy)

| Strategy | Potential Saving | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Skip US national phase (C4.x only) | −€12,000 | No USPTO protection for cross-industry verticals |
| Skip JP national phase for all applications | −€19,200 | No JPO protection |
| Limit EP validation to CH + NO (skip TR) | −€10,800 | No Turkish market protection |
| File C1.2 + C2.1 as EP divisionals of P0 | −€12,560 | Narrower independent claims per divisional |
| Skip Phase 5 CIPs initially | −€50,000 | No domain-specific aerospace protection until later |
| Use in-house European Patent Attorney | −€30,000+ | Requires qualified EPA on staff |
