# Filing Timeline — AQUA-V Patent Portfolio

**Portfolio:** AQUA-V (QAPD + QAOS)  
**Reference Date (Day 0):** 2026-02-19  
**Authority:** ASIT / CCB  
**Governance:** EU Framework — IP registries reside in the EU (EPO, Munich)

> **EU Framework constraint:** All priority-setting filings are made at the EPO (EU institution). PCT filings designate EPO as ISA. Unitary Patent requested upon EP grant for EU-wide coverage under single EU registry.
