## Fire Protection Safety Provisions

Safety baselines for fire protection systems require **STK_SAF co-approval** in
addition to standard CCB approval. This applies to:

- All safety analysis outputs (FHA, PSSA, SSA).
- Fire/smoke detection system configuration.
- Suppression agent selection and compatibility.
- Emergency procedure definitions.
- H₂-related fire protection measures.

## Baseline Modifications

All modifications to established baselines require an ECR/ECO cycle through the change control process defined in [GOVERNANCE_POLICY.md](GOVERNANCE_POLICY.md).
