## 1. Architecture Decisions

These selections are derived from the LC04 trade studies and constitute
the frozen functional architecture for the AMPEL360 Q100 LH₂ fuel
storage system.

| Decision | Trade Study | Selected Option | Baseline Name |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| FBL-DEC-001 | TS-28-10-TS01 | A — Circular Cylinder | Circular Cryogenic Cell (CCC) |
| FBL-DEC-002 | TS-28-10-TS02 | C — Multi-Cell Distributed | Distributed Circular Cryogenic Cells |

### FBL-DEC-001 — Tank Geometry

- Uniform hoop stress (σ\_hoop = P·r / t) — lowest structural risk
- Predictable cryogenic thermal behaviour
- Deterministic modelling compatibility (5D addressable tank states)
- Compatible with modular distributed storage (zones 610–640)
- Proven certification path (NASA, Airbus ZEROe heritage)

### FBL-DEC-002 — Storage Architecture

- Excellent CG stability
- High redundancy — zonal isolation (fire / leak containment)
- Aligned with ZNNN 600–699 hazard zoning
- Aligned with modular propulsion architecture (500–599)
- Deterministic isolation logic (5D system state s-dimension)

### FBL-DEC-003 — Insulation Concept

- Heritage from existing cryogenic systems
- Predictable boil-off modelling
- Highest TRL among candidates

## Governance

This functional baseline is registered in `GOVERNANCE/BASELINE_REGISTER.csv`.
Modifications require an ECR/ECO cycle through the change control process.
Safety-related changes require **STK_SAF co-approval** per hydrogen-specific
provisions in `GOVERNANCE/BASELINES.md`.
