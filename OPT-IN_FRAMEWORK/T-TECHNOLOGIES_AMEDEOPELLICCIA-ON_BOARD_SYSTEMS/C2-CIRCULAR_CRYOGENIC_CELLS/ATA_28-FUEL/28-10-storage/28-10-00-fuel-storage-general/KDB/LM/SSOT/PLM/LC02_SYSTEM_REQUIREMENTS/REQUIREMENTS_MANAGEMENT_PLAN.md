# Requirements Management Plan — 28-10-00

## Capture

Requirements are derived from:
- CS-25 Special Conditions (SC-28-H2-001, SC-28-CRYO-002)
- ARP4754A system development process
- KNOT/KNU outputs from LC01

## Review

All requirements undergo peer review by STK_ENG and
safety review by STK_SAF for safety-critical items.

## Baseline

Requirements are baselined as part of the FBL (Functional Baseline)
and registered in `GOVERNANCE/BASELINE_REGISTER.csv`.

## Traceability

Each requirement must trace to:
- **Backward:** Parent requirement or KNOT source
- **Forward:** Design element (LC04) and test case (LC06)

All traces are recorded in `TRACE_LC02.csv`.
