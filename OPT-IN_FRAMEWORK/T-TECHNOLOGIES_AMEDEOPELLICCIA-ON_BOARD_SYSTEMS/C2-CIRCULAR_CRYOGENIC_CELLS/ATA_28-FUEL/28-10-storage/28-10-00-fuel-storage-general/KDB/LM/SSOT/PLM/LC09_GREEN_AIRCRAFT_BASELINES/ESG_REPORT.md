## Zero-Emission Focus

The C2 cryogenic hydrogen storage system enables zero-emission
flight operations. Hydrogen fuel produces only water as a
combustion or fuel-cell byproduct.

## Environmental Impact

- **In-flight emissions:** Zero CO₂, zero NOx (fuel cell mode)
- **Ground operations:** Green hydrogen sourcing targeted
- **Material lifecycle:** 316L and 5083 alloys are recyclable
- **End-of-life:** Designed for disassembly per LC14

## Sustainability Metrics

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| CO₂ per flight hour | 0 kg (fuel cell) | Design phase |
| Material recyclability | > 90% by mass | On track |
| Green H₂ sourcing | 100% by 2030 | Planning |
