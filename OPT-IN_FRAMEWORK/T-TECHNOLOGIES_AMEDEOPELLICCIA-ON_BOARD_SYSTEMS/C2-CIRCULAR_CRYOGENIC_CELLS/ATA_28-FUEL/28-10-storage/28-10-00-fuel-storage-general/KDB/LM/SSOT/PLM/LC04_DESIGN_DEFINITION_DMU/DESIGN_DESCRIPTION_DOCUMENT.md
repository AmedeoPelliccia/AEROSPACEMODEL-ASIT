## C2 Circular Cryogenic Cell

The C2 fuel storage cell uses a circular cross-section geometry
optimized for cryogenic hydrogen containment at -253°C.

### Structural Design

- **Inner shell:** 316L stainless steel (cryogenic-compatible)
- **Outer shell:** 5083 aluminum alloy (structural, lightweight)
- **Insulation:** 40-layer Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI)
- **Vacuum jacket:** Maintained between inner and outer shells
- **Operating pressure:** 1–6 bar nominal

### Key Design Features

- Circular geometry minimizes stress concentrations
- Vacuum-jacketed MLI provides thermal isolation
- Dual pressure relief system (valves + burst discs)
- Integrated leak detection sensor ports
- Modular interface to ATA 28 distribution system

### Design Status

Phase: LC04 — Preliminary Design  
Next gate: PDR (2026-06-30)
