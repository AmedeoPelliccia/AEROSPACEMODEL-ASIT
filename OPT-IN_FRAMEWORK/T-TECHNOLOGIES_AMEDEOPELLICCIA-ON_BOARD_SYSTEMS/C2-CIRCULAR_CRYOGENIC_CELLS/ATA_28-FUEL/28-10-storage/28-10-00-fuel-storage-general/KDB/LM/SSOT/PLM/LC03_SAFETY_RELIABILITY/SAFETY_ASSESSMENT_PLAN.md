# Safety Assessment Plan — 28-10-00

## Methodology

Safety assessment follows ARP4761 for hydrogen cryogenic systems:

1. **FHA** — Functional Hazard Assessment at aircraft and system level
2. **PSSA** — Preliminary System Safety Assessment during design
3. **SSA** — System Safety Assessment during verification

## Hydrogen-Specific Hazards

Key failure modes per ARP4761:
- LH₂ tank leak (Catastrophic, < 1E-9/FH)
- Excessive boil-off (Hazardous, < 1E-7/FH)
- Pressure relief valve failure (Hazardous, < 1E-7/FH)
- H₂ ignition (Catastrophic, < 1E-9/FH)

## Approval

All safety assessments require STK_SAF review and approval.
Safety content generation requires escalation per SAFETY-H2-001.

## Traceability

Hazards trace to requirements (LC02) and mitigations (LC04).
