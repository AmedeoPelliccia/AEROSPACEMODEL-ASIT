objective: >
  Define the parametric model for circular cryogenic cell cross-section
  optimisation.  The model captures geometry, structural sizing, and
  volumetric efficiency as functions of internal radius, operating
  pressure, wall thickness, and material properties in order to minimise
  structural mass while meeting pressure containment and fatigue
  requirements per CS 25.571.

optimisation:

    Multi-objective: mass + length penalty + surface-area penalty.
    Area term connects to MLI heat-leak trade (PM-28-10-PM02 / KNU-C2-001).
    Under pure stress-limited thin-wall sizing (t_w proportional to P*r_i/sigma),
    mass scales as V/pi + (2/3)*r_i^3, which is monotonic in r_i.
    Therefore the optimisation collapses to min-radius unless additional
    constraints (max length, max area, bay geometry, feed hardware clearance)
    are active.
  constraints:
    - "sigma_vM(P_limit) <= sigma_allow_limit"
    - "sigma_vM(P_ultimate) <= sigma_allow_ult"
    - "t_w / r_i <= 0.10 (thin-wall validity)"
    - "t_w >= max(t_w_min, t_mfg, t_NDE, t_corr)"
    - "V_int >= V_required"
    - "Fatigue life >= N_cycles (CS 25.571 pressure cycle spectrum)"
