objective: >
  Define the parametric model for circular cryogenic cell cross-section
  optimisation.  The model captures geometry, structural sizing, and
  volumetric efficiency as functions of internal radius, operating
  pressure, wall thickness, and material properties in order to minimise
  structural mass while meeting pressure containment and fatigue
  requirements per CS 25.571.
