objective: >
  Define the thermal stack-up model for vacuum-jacketed multi-layer
  insulation (MLI) on circular cryogenic cells.  Predict total heat
  leak as a function of layer count, installation density, vacuum level,
  boundary temperatures, and integration losses (seams and penetrations)
  to estimate boil-off and size insulation per TS-28-10-TS03 (Option A).

governing_equations:
  - name: "Radiation heat flux (modified Lockheed MLI model)"
    expression: >
      q_rad = C_r * epsilon_eff * (T_h^4.67 - T_c^4.67) / N_layers
    unit: "W/m²"
    notes: >
      C_r = radiation constant; epsilon_eff = effective emissivity of
      reflector/spacer assembly.  Exponent 4.67 from Lockheed fit
      accounts for radiation + solid conduction coupling.

  - name: "Solid conduction heat flux (Dacron spacer)"
    expression: >
      q_cond = C_s * n_density^2.63 * (T_h - T_c) / N_layers
    unit: "W/m²"
    notes: >
      C_s = McIntosh conductivity coefficient; n_density dependence
      captures contact pressure effect on inter-layer conduction.

  - name: "Residual gas conduction heat flux"
    expression: >
      q_gas = C_g * P_vac * (T_h - T_c)
    unit: "W/m²"
    notes: >
      Free-molecule regime conduction; linear in pressure.  Dominant
      only when P_vac > ~1E-4 torr.  This is a heat flux term (per
      unit area), not a total heat rate.

  - name: "Total blanket heat flux"
    expression: >
      q_MLI = q_rad + q_cond + q_gas
    unit: "W/m²"
    notes: "Sum of all areal heat flux contributions through the MLI blanket"

  - name: "Seam heat leak (additive, total rate)"
    expression: >
      Q_dot_seam = k_seam * L_seam
    unit: "W"
    notes: >
      k_seam ≈ 0.169 W/m (NASA measured value for 30-layer MLI with
      LH₂ sink).  This is a total heat rate adder, not per-area.

  - name: "Penetration heat leak (additive, total rate)"
    expression: >
      Q_dot_pen = n_pen * q_pen_avg
    unit: "W"
    notes: >
      q_pen_avg ≈ 0.31–0.50 W per penetration (composite–aluminium
      strut range from NASA calorimetry).  Total heat rate adder.

  - name: "Total cell heat leak rate"
    expression: >
      Q_dot_total = A_CCC * q_MLI + Q_dot_seam + Q_dot_pen
    unit: "W"
    notes: "Blanket areal flux × area + integration loss adders"

  - name: "Boil-off mass flow rate"
    expression: >
      m_dot_boil = Q_dot_total / h_fg
    unit: "kg/s"
    notes: >
      h_fg ≈ 447 kJ/kg for para-hydrogen at 20 K (NIST).
