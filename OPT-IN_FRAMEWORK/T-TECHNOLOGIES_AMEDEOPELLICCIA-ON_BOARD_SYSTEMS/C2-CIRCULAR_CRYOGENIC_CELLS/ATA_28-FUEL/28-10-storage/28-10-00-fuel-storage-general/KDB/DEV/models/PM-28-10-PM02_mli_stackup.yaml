objective: >
  Define the thermal stack-up model for vacuum-jacketed multi-layer
  insulation on circular cryogenic cells.  The model predicts total
  heat leak as a function of MLI layer count, layer density, vacuum
  level, boundary temperatures, and integration losses (seams and
  penetrations) to enable boil-off rate estimation and insulation
  sizing per the selected baseline (TS-28-10-TS03, Option A).

governing_equations:
  - name: "Radiation heat flux (modified Lockheed MLI model)"
    expression: >
      q_rad = C_r * epsilon_eff * (T_h^4.67 - T_c^4.67) / N
    notes: >
      C_r = radiation constant; epsilon_eff = effective emissivity of
      reflector/spacer assembly.  Exponent 4.67 from Lockheed fit
      accounts for radiation + solid conduction coupling.

  - name: "Solid conduction heat flux (Dacron spacer)"
    expression: >
      q_cond = C_s * N_star^2.63 * (T_h - T_c) / N
    notes: >
      C_s = McIntosh conductivity coefficient; N_star dependence
      captures contact pressure effect on inter-layer conduction.

  - name: "Residual gas conduction"
    expression: >
      q_gas = C_g * P_vac * (T_h - T_c)
    notes: >
      Free-molecule regime conduction; linear in pressure.  Dominant
      only when P_vac > ~1E-4 torr.

  - name: "Total blanket heat flux"
    expression: >
      q_MLI = q_rad + q_cond + q_gas
    unit: "W/m²"

  - name: "Seam heat leak"
    expression: >
      Q_seam = k_seam * L_seam
    notes: >
      k_seam ≈ 0.169 W/m (NASA measured value for 30-layer MLI with
      LH₂ sink).

  - name: "Penetration heat leak"
    expression: >
      Q_pen = n_pen * q_pen_avg
    notes: >
      q_pen_avg ≈ 0.31–0.50 W per penetration (composite–aluminium
      strut range from NASA calorimetry).

  - name: "Total cell heat leak"
    expression: >
      Q_total = A_CCC * q_MLI + Q_seam + Q_pen
    unit: "W"

  - name: "Boil-off rate"
    expression: >
      m_dot_boil = Q_total / h_fg
    notes: >
      h_fg ≈ 447 kJ/kg for para-hydrogen at 20 K (NIST).
