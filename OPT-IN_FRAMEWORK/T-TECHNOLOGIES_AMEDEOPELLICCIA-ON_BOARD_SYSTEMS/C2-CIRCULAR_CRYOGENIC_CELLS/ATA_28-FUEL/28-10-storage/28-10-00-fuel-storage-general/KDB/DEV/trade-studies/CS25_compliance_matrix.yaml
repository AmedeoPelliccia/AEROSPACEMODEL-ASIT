# CS-25 Compliance Matrix — ATA 28-10-00 Fuel Storage General (LH₂ Cryogenic Cells)
# AMPEL360 Q100 — C2 Circular Cryogenic Cells
#
# NOTE: CS-25 is written for conventional fuels.  LH₂ cryogenic storage
# requires an additional package of Special Conditions (SC), Issue Papers,
# and Means of Compliance agreed with EASA.  Items marked "SC-LH2-*"
# flag those gaps explicitly.
