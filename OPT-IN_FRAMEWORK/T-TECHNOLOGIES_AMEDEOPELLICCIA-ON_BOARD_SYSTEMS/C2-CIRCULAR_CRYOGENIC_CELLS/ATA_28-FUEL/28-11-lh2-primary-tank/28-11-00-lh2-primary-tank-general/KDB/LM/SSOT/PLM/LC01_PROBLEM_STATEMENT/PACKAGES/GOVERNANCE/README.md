# GOVERNANCE — LC01 Problem Statement SSOT Package (ATA 28-11)

This package defines the binding governance baseline for the ATA 28-11 lifecycle.
It establishes foundational axiom, constitutional controls, accountability, safety
precedence, labor continuity, and escalation rules that all downstream packages must satisfy.

## Non-negotiables
- Deny-by-default governance enforcement
- No significant change without signed accountable commit
- No plausible-harm progression without DEGRADE/PAUSE/ESCALATE
- No net human exclusion without reabsorption plan
- No silent override in conflicts
