objective: >
  Evaluate insulation and thermal control concepts for the LH2
  primary tank comparing vacuum-jacketed MLI, foam, and active
  cooling approaches for heat flux, boil-off performance,
  system complexity, and vacuum integrity sensitivity.

      certification: "Requires MoC for active safety-critical thermal controls"
      heritage: "NASA zero boil-off research programmes"

critical_design_insight: >
  Supports and penetrations can dominate heat leak. NASA IRAS analysis
  shows that despite small conduction areas, support-pad conduction can
  be comparable to or exceed the MLI contribution, and large man-way
  penetrations can represent a substantial fraction of total heat leak.

preliminary_selection:
  selected_option: "A"
  baseline_name: "Vacuum Jacket + MLI with Engineered Thermal Bridges"
  rationale:
    - "Heritage from NASA cryogenic tank programmes"
    - "Measured system heat flux ~1.3 W/m^2 achievable when thermal bridges are managed"
    - "Predictable boil-off modelling (steady-state Q/h_fg method)"
    - "Thermal bridge engineering (supports, penetrations) is the primary design lever"
