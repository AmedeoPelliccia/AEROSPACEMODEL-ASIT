# SDR-28 — System Domain Resolution (Layer D5)
# ATA 28 Fuel System — Circular Cryogenic Cells
# AMPEL360 Q100
#
# Purpose: Top-level entry point of the 5-dimensional token model.
# Resolves which ATA system domain a model request targets, enumerates
# the available sections (SCR tokens), and provides the system-level
# context for downstream routing through all five layers.

description: >
  Layer D5 (top) of the 5-dimensional token model.  This is the
  single entry point for the entire ATA 28 Fuel System.  A model
  consuming the SDR-28 token receives the system-level context —
  mission, scope, regulatory baseline, special conditions, and the
  full map of available sections (SCR tokens) — enabling deterministic
  routing through all five layers down to individual subject tokens.

system_context:
  mission: >
    Provide a safe, certifiable cryogenic hydrogen fuel system for the
    AMPEL360 Q100 hydrogen-electric aircraft.  The system stores,
    distributes, and manages liquid hydrogen (LH₂) at -253 deg C using
    circular cryogenic cell architecture.
  scope:
    - "LH₂ storage (primary and auxiliary cryogenic tanks)"
    - "Distribution (cryogenic transfer, insulated lines, pressure control)"
    - "Boil-off management (BOG capture, venting, thermal management)"
    - "Safety systems (H₂ leak detection, pressure relief, fire protection)"
    - "Ground handling (refuelling, defuelling, purge, warm-up)"
    - "Indication (fuel quantity, temperature, pressure monitoring)"
  regulatory_basis:
    - "CS-25 (airworthiness)"
    - "S1000D Issue 5.0 (technical data)"
    - "DO-160 (environmental qualification)"
    - "ARP4754A (system development assurance)"
    - "ARP4761 (safety assessment)"
