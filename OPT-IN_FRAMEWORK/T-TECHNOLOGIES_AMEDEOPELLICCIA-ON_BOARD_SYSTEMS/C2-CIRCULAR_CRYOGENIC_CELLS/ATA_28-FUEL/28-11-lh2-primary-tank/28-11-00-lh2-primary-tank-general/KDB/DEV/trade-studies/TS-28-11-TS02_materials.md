## Objective

Evaluate inner-vessel containment materials for the LH2 primary
tank comparing aluminium-lithium alloys, austenitic stainless
steels, and composite overwrap / all-composite concepts for
structural efficiency, cryogenic performance, permeation risk,
and certification maturity.

## Options Considered

| Option | Name | Structural Efficiency | Cryogenic Performance | Permeation Risk | Certification Risk |
|--------|------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| A | Aluminium-Lithium (2195 family) | High | Excellent — strength increases at 20 K | Low | Low–Medium |
| B | Austenitic Stainless Steel (304L family) | Medium | Good — notch toughness to ~−250 °C | Very Low | Low |
| C | Composite Overwrap / All-Composite | Very High (aspirational) | Variable — microcracking risk | High | High |

### Option A — Aluminium-Lithium (2195 family)

- **Yield strength at 20 K:** 724 MPa
- **UTS at 20 K:** 859 MPa
- **Density penalty:** Low — lightweight alloy
- **Weld qualification:** Established but requires cryogenic fatigue/crack-growth allowables
- **NDI methods:** Well-known metallic NDI (ultrasonic, radiographic)
- **Heritage:** NASA SLS, prior cryogenic tank programmes

### Option B — Austenitic Stainless Steel (304L family)

- **Cryogenic toughness:** Robust fracture and crack-arrest behaviour to ~−250 °C
- **Density penalty:** Significant — high density increases OEW
- **Thermal conductivity:** Higher than Al-Li — increases parasitic heat leak paths
- **Weld qualification:** Mature cryogenic welding practice
- **Heritage:** Wide cryogenic industry use

### Option C — Composite Overwrap / All-Composite

- **Gravimetric efficiency:** 0.55–0.85 (aspirational)
- **Microcracking risk:** Core risk — microcracking enables hydrogen permeation
- **Manufacturing variability:** Critical failure mode driver
- **NDI methods:** Complex multi-physics inspection required
- **Heritage:** NASA Composite Cryotank Technologies and Demonstration (Boeing)

## Preliminary Selection

**Selected Option:** A — Aluminium-Lithium (2195 family)
**Baseline Name:** Al-Li 2195 Metallic Inner Vessel

### Rationale

- Best specific strength with demonstrated cryogenic performance at 20 K
- Metallic impermeability eliminates hydrogen permeation risk
- Well-aligned with metallic pressure vessel certification logic
- Compatible with established NDI and damage tolerance methodology
- Weld/fatigue allowables are achievable within near-term certification timeline
