# CS-25 Compliance Matrix — ATA 28-11-00 LH2 Primary Tank (Cryogenic Cells)
# AMPEL360 Q100 — C2 Circular Cryogenic Cells
#
# NOTE: CS-25 is written for conventional fuels.  LH2 primary tank
# storage requires an additional package of Special Conditions (SC),
# Issue Papers, and Means of Compliance agreed with EASA.  Items
# marked "SC-LH2-*" flag those gaps explicitly.
