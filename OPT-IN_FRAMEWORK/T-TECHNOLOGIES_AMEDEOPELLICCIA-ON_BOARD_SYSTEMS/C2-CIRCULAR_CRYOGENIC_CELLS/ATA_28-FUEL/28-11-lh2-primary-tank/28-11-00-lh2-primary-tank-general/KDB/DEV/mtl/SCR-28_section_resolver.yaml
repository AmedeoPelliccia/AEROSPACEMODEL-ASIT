# SCR-28 — Section / Component Resolution (Layer D4)
# ATA 28 Fuel System — Circular Cryogenic Cells
# AMPEL360 Q100
#
# Purpose: Resolves which ATA 28 section/component a model request
# targets.  Each SCR token maps 1-to-1 to an ATA 28 sub-system
# section and enumerates the available STP procedures at that section.
# This is Layer D4 of the 5-dimensional token architecture.

description: >
  Layer D4 of the 5D token model.  Each SCR token identifies an
  ATA 28 sub-system section and lists the Standard Token Procedures
  (STPs) available at that section.  A model consuming one SCR token
  resolves the target component and can then dispatch to the correct
  STP layer (D3).
