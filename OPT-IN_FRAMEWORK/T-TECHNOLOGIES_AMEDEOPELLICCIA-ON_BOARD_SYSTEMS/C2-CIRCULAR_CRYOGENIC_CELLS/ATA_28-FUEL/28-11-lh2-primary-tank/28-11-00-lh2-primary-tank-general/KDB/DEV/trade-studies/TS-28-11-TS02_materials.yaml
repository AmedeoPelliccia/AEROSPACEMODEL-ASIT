objective: >
  Evaluate inner-vessel containment materials for the LH2 primary
  tank comparing aluminium-lithium alloys, austenitic stainless
  steels, and composite overwrap / all-composite concepts for
  structural efficiency, cryogenic performance, permeation risk,
  and certification maturity.

options:
  - id: A
    name: "Aluminium-Lithium (2195 family)"
    description: "Al-Li metallic inner vessel"
    structural_efficiency: "High"
    cryogenic_performance: "Excellent — strength increases at 20 K"
    permeation_risk: "Low — metallic impermeability to hydrogen"
    certification_risk: "Low-Medium"
    analysis:
      yield_strength_20K_MPa: 724
      uts_20K_MPa: 859
      density_penalty: "Low — lightweight alloy"
      weld_qualification: "Established but requires cryogenic fatigue/crack-growth allowables"
      ndi_methods: "Well-known metallic NDI (ultrasonic, radiographic)"
      heritage: "NASA SLS, prior cryogenic tank programmes"

  - id: B
    name: "Austenitic Stainless Steel (304L family)"
    description: "Stainless steel inner vessel"
    structural_efficiency: "Medium"
    cryogenic_performance: "Good — notch toughness to ~-250 degC"
    permeation_risk: "Very Low — excellent hydrogen barrier"
    certification_risk: "Low"
    analysis:
      cryogenic_toughness: "Robust fracture and crack-arrest behaviour to ~-250 degC"
      density_penalty: "Significant — high density increases OEW"
      thermal_conductivity: "Higher than Al-Li — increases parasitic heat leak paths"
      weld_qualification: "Mature cryogenic welding practice"
      heritage: "Wide cryogenic industry use"

  - id: C
    name: "Composite Overwrap / All-Composite"
    description: "Composite or composite-overwrapped pressure vessel"
    structural_efficiency: "Very High (aspirational)"
    cryogenic_performance: "Variable — risk of microcracking at cryogenic temperatures"
    permeation_risk: "High — microcracking-driven infiltration and secondary pressure effects"
    certification_risk: "High"
    analysis:
      gravimetric_efficiency: "0.55-0.85 (aspirational)"
      microcracking_risk: "Core risk — microcracking enables hydrogen permeation"
      manufacturing_variability: "Critical failure mode driver"
      ndi_methods: "Complex multi-physics inspection required"
      heritage: "NASA Composite Cryotank Technologies and Demonstration (Boeing)"

preliminary_selection:
  selected_option: "A"
  baseline_name: "Al-Li 2195 Metallic Inner Vessel"
  rationale:
    - "Best specific strength with demonstrated cryogenic performance at 20 K"
    - "Metallic impermeability eliminates hydrogen permeation risk"
    - "Well-aligned with metallic pressure vessel certification logic"
    - "Compatible with established NDI and damage tolerance methodology"
    - "Weld/fatigue allowables are achievable within near-term certification timeline"
