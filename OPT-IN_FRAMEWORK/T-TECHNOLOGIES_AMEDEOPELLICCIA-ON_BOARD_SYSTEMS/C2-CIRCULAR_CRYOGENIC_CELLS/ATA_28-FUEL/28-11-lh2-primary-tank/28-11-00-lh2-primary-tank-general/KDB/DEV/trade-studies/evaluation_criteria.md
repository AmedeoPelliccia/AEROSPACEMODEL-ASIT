## Summary

Cylindrical Al-Li Vacuum-MLI configuration scores highest
across weighted criteria.  This combines:

- **TS-28-11-TS01 Option B** — Cylindrical Hemispherical
- **TS-28-11-TS02 Option A** — Al-Li 2195
- **TS-28-11-TS03 Option A** — Vacuum + MLI with engineered thermal bridges

## Open Risks

| Risk ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| RISK-01 | Vacuum integrity degradation in service (MLI performance sensitivity to vacuum quality) |
| RISK-02 | Support-pad and penetration heat leak dominating system thermal budget |
| RISK-03 | Cryogenic fatigue in Al-Li weld zones under cyclic mission profiles |
| RISK-04 | Gravimetric efficiency uncertainty (published range 0.3–0.9 for aircraft LH₂ tanks) |
| RISK-05 | Special conditions scope for hydrogen certification (SC timeline uncertainty) |
