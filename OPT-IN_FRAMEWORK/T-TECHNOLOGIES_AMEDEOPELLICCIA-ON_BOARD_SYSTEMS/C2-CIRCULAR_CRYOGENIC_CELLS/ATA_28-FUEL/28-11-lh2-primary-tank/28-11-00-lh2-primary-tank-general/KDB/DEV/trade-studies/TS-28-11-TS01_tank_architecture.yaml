objective: >
  Determine optimal primary tank architecture for LH2 storage
  within a circular cryogenic cell, comparing spherical,
  cylindrical (hemispherical endcaps), and conformal/integral
  geometries for mass, boil-off, certification risk, and
  integration efficiency.

  - id: C
    name: "Conformal / Integral"

      stress_model: "Complex load paths"
      manufacturing: "Highest QA burden"
      certification_uncertainty: "Less mature crashworthiness and inspection narrative"
      inspection_access: "Difficult — structural integration complicates repairs"

preliminary_selection:
  selected_option: "B"
  baseline_name: "Cylindrical Hemispherical Non-Integral Tank"
  rationale:
    - "Lowest overall certification risk for near-term implementation"
    - "Scalable manufacturing with well-understood weld qualification"
    - "Natural fit for modular circular cryogenic cell layout"
    - "Leverages measured ~1.3 W/m^2 class system heat flux when thermal bridges are managed"
    - "Compatible with 5D addressable tank states and deterministic modelling"
