# ATA 28 – Baseline Definitions

**System:** AMPEL360 Q100 LH₂ Fuel System (C2 Circular Cryogenic Cells)
**ATA Chapter:** 28 – Fuel
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Baseline Types

### FBL – Functional Baseline

- **Established at:** LC02 (System Requirements Review)
- **Scope:** Locks allocated requirements, functional architecture, and
  interface definitions for the ATA 28 fuel system.
- **Contents:** System requirements document, functional block diagrams,
  interface control documents.

### DBL – Design Baseline

- **Established at:** LC04 (Critical Design Review)
- **Scope:** Locks detailed design, safety analysis outputs, and material
  selections for cryogenic cells and distribution system.
- **Contents:** Detailed design data, PSSA/SSA reports, materials
  qualification plan, S1000D data modules (draft).

### PBL – Product Baseline

- **Established at:** LC10 (Production Readiness)
- **Scope:** Locks production configuration, manufacturing processes,
  and as-built documentation.
- **Contents:** Manufacturing drawings, process specifications, first-article
  inspection reports, final S1000D publication set.

## Hydrogen-Specific Provisions

Safety baselines for hydrogen systems require **STK_SAF co-approval** in
addition to standard CCB approval. This applies to:

- All safety analysis outputs (FHA, PSSA, SSA).
- H₂ leak detection system configuration.
- Emergency procedure definitions.
- Cryogenic handling procedure specifications.

## Baseline Modifications

All modifications to established baselines require an ECR/ECO cycle
through the change control process. See [CHANGE_CONTROL/](CHANGE_CONTROL/).

## Register

See [BASELINE_REGISTER.csv](BASELINE_REGISTER.csv) for the current baseline status.
