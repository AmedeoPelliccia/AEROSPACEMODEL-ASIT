  scope: |
    Configuration management guidelines for technical products and services,
    covering configuration identification, configuration control, configuration
    status accounting, and configuration audit to maintain product integrity
    throughout the product lifecycle.
  why_it_applies_to_M1: |
    Essential for controlling engineering changes and maintaining product
    traceability throughout the AMPEL360 Q100 manufacturing lifecycle. Ensures
    that the as-built configuration of safety-critical components matches the
    approved design baseline, and that all Engineering Change Requests (ECR)
    and Engineering Change Orders (ECO) are processed in a controlled manner.
  evidence_expected:
    - Configuration Management Plan
    - Engineering Change Records (ECR/ECO)
    - Configuration Status Accounting Records
    - Configuration Audit Reports
    - Baseline Configuration Documentation
  audit_questions:
    - Is a Configuration Management Plan documented and implemented?
    - Are Engineering Change Requests (ECR) and Engineering Change Orders (ECO) controlled through a formal process?
    - Is configuration status accounting performed to track the current approved configuration?
    - Are configuration audits (functional and physical) conducted before delivery milestones?
    - Is product traceability maintained from design baseline through as-built configuration?
