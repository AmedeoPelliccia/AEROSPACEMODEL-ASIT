  scope: |
    Requirements for first article inspection of new parts or processes, covering
    Form 1 (Part Number Accountability), Form 2 (Product Accountability), and
    Form 3 (Characteristic Accountability). Applies to new part introductions,
    design changes, manufacturing process changes, and production re-starts.
  why_it_applies_to_M1: |
    Ensures new parts meet all design and specification requirements before
    entering production. FAI per AS9102 is required for all new aerospace parts
    and assemblies in the AMPEL360 Q100 program, including hydrogen storage
    tank components, fuel cell stack assemblies, and structural elements,
    confirming that the manufacturing process is capable of producing conforming
    hardware.
  evidence_expected:
    - FAI Reports per AS9102 Form 1 (Part Number Accountability)
    - FAI Reports per AS9102 Form 2 (Product Accountability)
    - FAI Reports per AS9102 Form 3 (Characteristic Accountability)
    - Dimensional Inspection Results
    - Material and Process Certificates
    - Functional Test Results
  audit_questions:
    - Are FAI reports completed per AS9102 (Form 1/2/3) for all new parts and processes?
    - Are partial FAIs (delta FAI) documented when design or process changes occur?
    - Are dimensional inspection results traceable to calibrated equipment?
    - Are material and special process certificates included in the FAI package?
    - Is the FAI package reviewed and approved before production release?
