  scope: |
    Quality management requirements for distributors and suppliers of aerospace
    parts, materials, and assemblies. Addresses traceability, storage, handling,
    counterfeit part prevention, and supplier qualification for the aerospace
    supply chain.
  why_it_applies_to_M1: |
    Supply chain and vendor qualification requirements for M1 manufacturing.
    Ensures that all purchased materials, parts, and assemblies meet aerospace
    quality standards and are fully traceable, preventing counterfeit or
    unapproved parts from entering the production of hydrogen storage tanks,
    fuel cell stacks, and structural components.
