  scope: |
    Special process qualification and accreditation covering welding, heat treatment,
    non-destructive testing (NDT), surface treatment, composites processing,
    chemical processing, and other critical manufacturing processes for aerospace
    and defense applications.
  why_it_applies_to_M1: |
    Required for critical manufacturing processes on hydrogen storage tanks,
    fuel cell stacks, and structural components. NADCAP accreditation ensures
    that special processes meet the highest aerospace quality standards and are
    performed by qualified personnel with approved procedures, which is essential
    for safety-critical components in the AMPEL360 Q100 aircraft.
  evidence_expected:
    - NADCAP Accreditation Certificates (per process category)
    - Process Qualification Records
    - Approved Process Specifications
    - Qualified Personnel Records
    - Equipment Calibration and Qualification Records
  audit_questions:
    - Are all applicable special processes (welding, NDT, heat treatment) NADCAP accredited?
    - Are NADCAP accreditation certificates current and within validity period?
    - Are process qualification records maintained for each NADCAP-accredited process?
    - Are personnel performing special processes qualified and certified per applicable standards?
    - Are process audits conducted per NADCAP audit criteria (AC series)?
