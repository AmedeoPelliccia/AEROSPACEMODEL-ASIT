## Overview

This document captures the operational procedures for parking, mooring, storing, and returning the AMPEL360 Q100 to service. It supplements the aircraft AMM ATA 10 procedures with infrastructure-specific steps.

> **Safety prerequisite:** Read [`05_SAFETY_RISKS.md`](05_SAFETY_RISKS.md) before starting any procedure.

## Operation 10-OPS-001 — Aircraft Parking

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Parking bay confirmed clear of FOD and obstacles.
- [ ] Bay H₂ ventilation confirmed running (if LH₂ aboard).
- [ ] Wheel chocks and tow bar available.

### Steps
1. Guide aircraft into bay using marshaller or visual docking system (PAPA/VDGS).
2. Apply nose-gear wheel chocks first, then main-gear chocks.
3. Connect bonding cable to aircraft bonding point (mandatory if LH₂ aboard).
4. Confirm aircraft is within painted parking limits.
5. Install pitot/static covers, engine intake blanks, and fuel/vent covers.
6. Log covers on/off in aircraft technical record.
7. Connect GPU if required for on-ground power.

## Operation 10-OPS-002 — Aircraft Mooring (Wind > 25 kt Forecast)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Mooring diagram posted in bay and available.
- [ ] Tie-down straps and chains inspected (no fraying, correct rating).

### Steps
1. Attach main-gear tie-down straps to per mooring diagram.
2. Attach tail tie-down chains per mooring diagram.
3. Tension all tie-downs to snug (not over-tensioned; check per AMM).
4. Record mooring in aircraft maintenance log.

## Operation 10-OPS-003 — LH₂ Boil-Off Management During Extended Parking ⭐

> **⭐ Special Condition:** Required when AMPEL360 Q100 is parked for > 4 h with LH₂ aboard.

### Options

**Option A — Boil-Off Recovery Connection (preferred):**
1. Connect boil-off recovery line to aircraft LH₂ vent port using cam-lock fitting.
2. Confirm recovery line valve open (coordinate with O-OPERATIONS H₂ GSE team).
3. Monitor LH₂ tank pressure; confirm pressure is stable or decreasing.
4. At end of parking period, close recovery valve before disconnecting line.

**Option B — Controlled Venting (if recovery unavailable):**
1. Confirm bay vent stack is operational.
2. Open aircraft LH₂ vent valve (controlled procedure; H₂ vented to stack).
3. Monitor H₂ detector — ventilation alarm must not activate during normal venting.
4. Log vent event in aircraft technical record.

## Operation 10-OPS-004 — Return to Service (RTS) Checklist Activation

### Prerequisites
- [ ] All maintenance tasks completed and signed off.
- [ ] All covers, blanks, and plugs removed and accounted for.
- [ ] H₂ system status verified (isolation valves status per ATA 28 procedures).

### RTS Steps
1. Remove all engine intake blanks, pitot/static covers, fuel/vent caps — verify against log.
2. Perform external walk-around inspection per AMM ATA 05.
3. For LH₂-equipped aircraft: verify H₂ vent line disconnected and port capped.
4. Verify H₂ detector functional test completed within last 24 h.
5. Remove wheel chocks (nose-gear last).
6. Disconnect bonding cable.
7. Release aircraft to flight operations.
