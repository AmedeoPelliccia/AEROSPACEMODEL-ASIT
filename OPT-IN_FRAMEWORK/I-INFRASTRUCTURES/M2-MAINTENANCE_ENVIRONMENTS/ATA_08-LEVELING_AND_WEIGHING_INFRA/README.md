## Infrastructure Requirements

### Leveling Equipment
- Aircraft jacking equipment rated for AMPEL360 Q100 MTOW
- Calibrated level indicators (digital inclinometers)
- Wing and fuselage datum reference hardware

### Weighing Equipment
- Platform scales or axle-load cells with current calibration certificates
- Ground support equipment (GSE) for scale positioning

### Facility Requirements
- Level hangar floor with known datum points
- Environmental controls to minimise wind effect during weighing
- Adequate clearance for full-span access
