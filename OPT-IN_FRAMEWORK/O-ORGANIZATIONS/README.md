# O-ORGANIZATIONS Domain

**ATA Chapters 00–05: Organizational and Governance Documentation**

---

## Scope

The O-ORGANIZATIONS domain contains organizational, governance, and policy-level documentation that establishes the framework for aircraft maintenance, operations, and airworthiness management.

---

## Subdomain Structure

The O-ORGANIZATIONS domain is organized into two subdomains that separate regulatory authority from business enforcement:

### A — Authoritative
**Agency, regulatory, and legal-derived** — Chapters rooted in certification authority requirements, airworthiness directives, and regulatory mandates. These define the legal framework within which the aircraft must operate.

### B — Business Enforcement
**Operator business policies and enforcement** — Chapters driven by the operator's business decisions for maintenance programs, organizational structure, and support logistics. These translate regulatory requirements into actionable business processes.
