# P-PROGRAMS Domain

**ATA Chapters 06–12: Program-Level Procedures and Servicing**

---

## Scope

The P-PROGRAMS domain contains program-level procedures for aircraft handling, servicing, and ground operations. This includes physical characteristics, ground handling procedures, and routine servicing operations.

---

## Subdomain Structure

The P-PROGRAMS domain is organized into two subdomains that mirror the classic distinction in aerospace documentation:

### P — Product Definition
**What the product is** — Chapters that define the aircraft's physical characteristics, weight, and identification on the ground. This subdomain feeds into configuration management workflows.

### S — Service Instruction
**How you handle it** — Chapters that describe how ground crews interact with the aircraft. This subdomain feeds into ground operations manual workflows.
