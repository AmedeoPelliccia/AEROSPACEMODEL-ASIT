## D — Digital Thread & Traceability

The "plumbing" of digital traceability — identifiers, DPP mechanics, and ledger infrastructure.

| ATA | Directory | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 96 | `D-DIGITAL_THREAD_TRACEABILITY/ATA_96-TRACEABILITY_DPP_LEDGER/` | Digital Product Passport, traceability, and ledger systems |

## A — AI Governance & Assurance

The "policy" layer — governance complement to ATA 95/97 technical content in T/I2.
Oversees how AI/ML models are certified, kept accountable, and made transparent.
