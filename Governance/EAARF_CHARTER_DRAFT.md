> **Document ID:** AEROSPACEMODEL-GOV-EAARF-001  
> **Full Name:** European Aviation AI Requirements Framework (EAARF)  
> **Type:** Forum Charter  
> **Status:** DRAFT  
> **Version:** 0.1

## 1. Purpose

The European Aviation AI Requirements Framework (EAARF) forum is
established to provide a collaborative platform for developing,
harmonizing, and maintaining AI requirements for aviation systems
within the European regulatory context.

This charter defines the forum's mission, scope, governance
structure, and operating procedures.

---

## 2. Mission

To advance safe, transparent, and trustworthy use of artificial
intelligence in aviation by:

1. **Harmonizing** AI requirements across EASA, ESA, and national
   aviation authorities.
2. **Developing** consensus-based technical standards and acceptable
   means of compliance for AI in aviation.
3. **Bridging** regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, EASA AI Roadmap,
   DO-178C) with practical implementation guidance.
4. **Enabling** industry–regulator dialogue on emerging AI
   technologies and their aviation applications.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In Scope

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| AI Certification | Requirements for certifying AI-based aviation systems |
| AI Assurance | Learning assurance, deterministic AI governance, verification |
| Human–AI Interaction | Human oversight, human factors, crew/AI interfaces |
| AI Maintenance | AI in continuing airworthiness and maintenance operations |
| AI Safety Assessment | AI-specific failure modes, ARP4761 extensions |
| AI Data Governance | Training data, operational data, S1000D integration |
| AI Ethics | Bias mitigation, fairness, transparency in aviation AI |

### 3.2 Out of Scope

- Military/defence AI applications (covered by separate frameworks)
- Non-aviation AI regulation (deferred to EU AI Act general guidance)
- Commercial AI product development (industry responsibility)
