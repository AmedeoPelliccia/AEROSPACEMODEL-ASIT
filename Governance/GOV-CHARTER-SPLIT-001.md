## 1. Purpose and Scope

This Governance Charter establishes the canonical boundary rules, editorial standards, and operational protocols governing the bifurcation of ideale.eu Enterprise digital presence into two strategically distinct domains. The separation is by vertical, not geography, ensuring that each domain operates with maximum coherence within its mandate and zero narrative contamination across domains.

This document is the single authoritative reference for all editorial, architectural, branding, and cross-linking decisions between the two domains. Any content, publication, or communication that touches either domain must comply with the rules codified herein.

### 1.1 Governing Principle

> Industrial execution and civilizational-scale strategy are complementary but must never be conflated. The aircraft is a product. The sovereign infrastructure is a doctrine. Mixing them dilutes both.

### 1.2 Scope of Application

This charter applies to all content produced under the ideale.eu Enterprise umbrella, including but not limited to: web publications, technical documentation, marketing materials, programmatic communications, conference presentations, investor materials, regulatory submissions, and API documentation surfaces.

---

## 3. Boundary Rules

These rules are mandatory and non-negotiable. Violations require immediate remediation and charter review.

### 3.1 Content Sovereignty

| Rule | aircraftmodel.eu | aerospacemodel.com |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **CR-01** | SHALL contain only aviation-industrial content: aircraft design, hydrogen systems, ATA breakdowns, certification artifacts, supply chain, product specifications. | SHALL contain only sovereign/strategic content: orbital governance, quantum infrastructure, constellation systems, diplomatic frameworks, meta-doctrine. |
| **CR-02** | SHALL NOT reference orbital governance, space diplomacy, quantum-classical bridge architectures, or GAIA constellation systems. | SHALL NOT reference specific aircraft models, ATA chapter details, hydrogen fuel cell product specifications, or supply chain logistics. |
| **CR-03** | SHALL NOT use language implying civilizational-scale or sovereign mandate. | SHALL NOT use language implying product catalog, commercial offering, or delivery schedule. |
| **CR-04** | May reference OPT-IN framework only as engineering methodology. | May reference OPT-IN framework as meta-doctrine and governance architecture. |
| **CR-05** | SHALL NOT contain any term from the Sovereign Exclusive Lexicon (§9.1). | SHALL NOT contain any term from the Industrial Exclusive Lexicon (§9.1). |

### 3.2 Cross-Linking Protocol

Cross-domain references are permitted only at the conceptual level and must follow these constraints:

- **Conceptual links only:** a reference may acknowledge that the other domain exists and state its general purpose, but must not deep-link to specific pages, artifacts, or technical content within the other domain.
- **No narrative embedding:** content from one domain must never be quoted, summarized, or paraphrased inline within the other domain. A single sentence acknowledging the sister domain is the maximum permissible reference.
- **Footer-level only:** if a cross-domain link appears, it must be in footer navigation or a dedicated "Related Entities" section, never in primary navigation, hero sections, or body content.
- **Shared parent reference:** both domains may reference ideale.eu Enterprise as the common parent entity. This is the only shared identity element.

### 3.3 Visual Identity Firewall

| Element | aircraftmodel.eu | aerospacemodel.com |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Primary Palette** | Aerospace white (#F8FAFC), Hydrogen blue (#2E75B6), Steel gray (#4472C4) | Space black (#0A0A0F), Platinum gold (#C4A035), Quantum violet (#7B68EE) |
| **Typography** | Sans-serif (industrial), monospace for technical data | Serif headings (institutional), sans-serif body |
| **Imagery Style** | Technical schematics, cryogenic renders, structured documentation, CAD-derived visuals | Orbital diagrams, quantum grid overlays, conceptual system maps, deep-field imagery |
| **Iconography** | Engineering symbols, ATA pictograms, hydrogen molecule | Orbital paths, quantum lattice, constellation nodes |
| **Logo Treatment** | ideale.eu sub-brand with aircraft silhouette | ideale.eu sub-brand with orbital ring |

## 4. Editorial Governance

### 4.1 Content Classification Matrix

| Content Type | aircraftmodel.eu | aerospacemodel.com |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| AMPEL360 aircraft architecture | EXCLUSIVE | — |
| LH₂ storage & cryogenic systems | EXCLUSIVE | — |
| ATA chapter breakdowns | EXCLUSIVE | — |
| Certification strategy (EASA/FAA) | EXCLUSIVE | — |
| Supply chain & product lines | EXCLUSIVE | — |
| Digital thread (LC01–LC14) | EXCLUSIVE | — |
| ESG & compliance reporting | EXCLUSIVE | — |
| S1000D technical publications | EXCLUSIVE | — |
| Orbital governance & space diplomacy | — | EXCLUSIVE |
| GAIA constellation architecture | — | EXCLUSIVE |
| Quantum-classical bridge architectures | — | EXCLUSIVE |
| QSS / QKD / quantum navigation | — | EXCLUSIVE |
| Sovereign coordination models | — | EXCLUSIVE |
| Climate & security systems (orbital) | — | EXCLUSIVE |
| OPT-IN as engineering methodology | PERMITTED | PERMITTED |
| OPT-IN as meta-doctrine | — | EXCLUSIVE |
| ideale.eu Enterprise overview | PERMITTED | PERMITTED |
| Teknia Token (TT) system | PERMITTED | PERMITTED |

### 4.2 Publication Review Gate

Before any content is published to either domain, it must pass through the following review gate:

1. **Domain Assignment Check** — Verify the content maps exclusively to the correct domain per the classification matrix above.
2. **Cross-Contamination Scan** — Run the automated keyword firewall (§9.1). Flag and remove any hits.
3. **Tone Alignment Audit** — Confirm the content matches the prescribed tone profile (industrial vs. institutional).
4. **Visual Identity Compliance** — Confirm all colors, typography, imagery, and iconography comply with the visual identity firewall.
5. **Cross-Link Validation** — If any cross-domain reference exists, confirm it meets the cross-linking protocol (conceptual only, footer-level, single sentence maximum).
6. **Ontology Classification Check** — Verify all entities referenced belong to the correct ontology namespace (§6.2).

### 4.3 Escalation Procedure

Content that cannot be cleanly assigned to a single domain (ambiguous cases) must be escalated to the Charter Owner for classification ruling. The ruling becomes precedent and is appended to the classification matrix in the next charter revision.

---

## 5. Shared Elements and Interfaces

While the domains are strictly separated, certain foundational elements are shared by both. These shared elements require special governance:

### 5.1 Canonical Doctrine Document

There shall exist exactly one canonical doctrine document that defines the ideale.eu Enterprise vision. This document lives at the enterprise level and is referenced (not copied) by both domains. It is maintained by the Charter Owner and versioned independently of either domain.

### 5.2 OPT-IN Framework

The OPT-IN Framework is the only conceptual asset that may appear in both domains, but with strict contextual framing:

| aircraftmodel.eu Context | aerospacemodel.com Context |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| OPT-IN as an engineering methodology for organizing 79 ATA chapters across five axes. Emphasis on SSOT + PUB workflow, lifecycle phases (LC01–LC14), and certification traceability. | OPT-IN as a meta-doctrine and governance architecture for organizing sovereign assets, quantum systems, and planetary-scale coordination. Emphasis on the five-axis topology as a universal organizing principle. |

### 5.3 Teknia Token System

The TT tokenomics system operates across both domains as an incentive alignment mechanism. Token pool definitions, distribution formulas, and ledger infrastructure are enterprise-level assets. Each domain references the TT system in its own context without redefining its mechanics.

### 5.4 ideale.eu Enterprise Identity

Both domains may display the ideale.eu Enterprise parent brand in a footer or "About" section. The parent brand must not dominate the visual hierarchy of either domain. Each domain's own identity must be primary.

### 5.5 Doctrine Precedence Order

To prevent implicit authority conflicts where a lower-tier document alters sovereign doctrine framing or industrial certification posture, the following precedence hierarchy is mandatory:

| Tier | Document Class | Authority |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | Enterprise Canonical Doctrine | Defines vision, mission, and strategic posture for the entire enterprise. Overrides all lower tiers. |
| 2 | Governance Charter (this document) | Defines domain boundaries, editorial rules, and enforcement. Overrides tiers 3–4. |
| 3 | Domain-Level Editorial Policies | Domain-specific style guides, tone rules, and publication workflows. Must comply with tiers 1–2. |
| 4 | Program Documentation | AMPEL360 technical docs, GAIA program specs, etc. Must comply with all higher tiers. |

In case of conflict between tiers, the higher-numbered tier yields. No program-level document may implicitly redefine terms, boundaries, or classifications established at tier 1 or 2.

---

## 6. Structural Coherence and Ontological Separation

### 6.1 Coherence Map

| Dimension | aircraftmodel.eu | aerospacemodel.com |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Operational Scale | Industrial | Civilizational |
| Economic Domain | Hydrogen economy | Space governance |
| Systems Focus | Aviation systems | Orbital systems |
| Infrastructure | Supply chains & GSE | Diplomatic infrastructure |
| Program Mode | Execution | Doctrine |
| Certification | EASA / FAA / DO-xxx | ITU / CCSDS / NIST |
| Time Horizon | Near-term (5–15 years) | Long-term (15–50+ years) |
| Revenue Model | Product / service | Sovereign / institutional |
| Risk Profile | Technical / regulatory | Geopolitical / strategic |

### 6.2 Ontological Separation Clause

Each domain operates within a formally defined ontology namespace. This ontological separation ensures long-term doctrinal purity and prevents conceptual drift.

#### 6.2.1 Product Ontology (aircraftmodel.eu)

All entities published on aircraftmodel.eu must classify under one or more of the following ontological categories:

- **Product** — physical or digital artifacts with specifications, part numbers, or certification requirements
- **Certification** — regulatory compliance artifacts, airworthiness evidence, type certificate data
- **Lifecycle** — engineering lifecycle artifacts from problem statement (LC01) through retirement (LC14)
- **Industrial Supply** — supply chain entities, vendors, logistics, GSE, MRO
- **Compliance Artifacts** — ESG reports, sustainability metrics, DPP records

#### 6.2.2 Sovereign Ontology (aerospacemodel.com)

All entities published on aerospacemodel.com must classify under one or more of the following ontological categories:

- **Governance** — regulatory frameworks, interoperability standards, coordination protocols
- **Sovereignty** — national/supranational infrastructure, strategic autonomy assets
- **Diplomacy** — international cooperation mechanisms, treaty-level constructs
- **Planetary Systems** — earth observation, climate monitoring, constellation architectures
- **Strategic Doctrine** — meta-frameworks, long-horizon positioning, civilizational coordination

#### 6.2.3 Ontological Firewall Rule

No entity classified under the Product Ontology may appear in the Sovereign Ontology namespace, and no entity classified under the Sovereign Ontology may appear in the Product Ontology namespace. This rule has no exceptions and is machine-enforced per §9.

## 7. Compliance and Enforcement

### 7.1 Violation Categories

| Severity | Description | Remediation |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **CRITICAL** | Content from one domain published in the other. Exclusive lexicon term detected by automated scan. Ontological namespace violation. | Immediate removal. Incident review within 48 hours. Charter amendment if systemic. |
| **HIGH** | Visual identity elements from one domain appearing in the other. Tone misalignment (e.g., product-catalog language on aerospacemodel.com). | Correction within 5 business days. Root cause analysis. |
| **MEDIUM** | Cross-domain links exceeding the permitted level (e.g., deep-linking instead of conceptual reference). | Correction within 10 business days. |
| **LOW** | Ambiguous content classification that could reasonably belong to either domain. | Escalation to Charter Owner for ruling. |

### 7.2 Audit Cadence

- **Monthly:** Automated cross-contamination scan (keyword firewall per §9.1) across both domains.
- **Quarterly:** Manual editorial review of all new content published in the period.
- **Annually:** Full charter review with stakeholder input. Version increment.

### 7.3 Charter Ownership and Continuity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Charter Owner** | Amedeo Pelliccia (Founder, ideale.eu Enterprise) |
| **Amendment Authority** | Charter Owner with documented rationale |
| **Review Board** | Domain leads + Charter Owner |
| **Version Control** | Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR). All amendments tracked. |
| **Canonical Location** | Enterprise-level repository, referenced by both domains |

### 7.4 Succession Mechanism

To ensure durability beyond the founder phase, the following succession protocol applies:

- The Charter Owner shall designate a named successor in a sealed, versioned annex to this charter.
- If the Charter Owner is incapacitated or unreachable for more than 90 consecutive days, the designated successor assumes Charter Ownership with full amendment authority.
- The Review Board may, by unanimous decision, appoint an interim Charter Owner if no designated successor exists or is available.
- Transfer of Charter Ownership is logged in the amendment log with effective date and rationale.

### 7.5 Version Freeze Protocol

A version freeze may be invoked by the Charter Owner or by unanimous Review Board decision. During a version freeze:

- No amendments to the charter are permitted, regardless of severity.
- The freeze period must not exceed 180 days without renewal.
- The freeze is logged in the amendment log with start date, rationale, and expected duration.
- Only the Emergency Override Clause (§7.6) can supersede a version freeze.

### 7.6 Emergency Override Clause

In the event of a material threat to enterprise continuity, regulatory compliance, or legal standing, the Charter Owner may invoke an emergency override:

- The override must be documented with a written justification referencing the specific threat.
- The override permits temporary deviation from any charter rule for a maximum of 30 days.
- Within 30 days, the deviation must be formalized as a charter amendment or reversed.
- If the Charter Owner is unavailable, the designated successor or unanimous Review Board may invoke the override.
- All emergency overrides are logged in the amendment log and flagged for the next annual review.

## 8. Risk Surface Analysis

### 8.1 Risks Without Enforcement

- Narrative drift over time as teams independently evolve content without boundary awareness.
- Public confusion between industrial product messaging and sovereign strategic positioning.
- SEO contamination where search engines cross-index content, diluting domain authority.
- Institutional credibility erosion if sovereign stakeholders encounter product-catalog messaging, or if certification authorities encounter non-technical strategic language.

### 8.2 Risk Mitigation Through Enforcement

- **Scalable brand clarity:** each domain builds independent authority within its vertical.
- **Clean investor segmentation:** industrial investors see product/market content; sovereign/strategic investors see doctrine and infrastructure.
- **Regulatory clarity:** certification authorities encounter only aviation-specific language and evidence.
- **Strategic coherence:** long-horizon stakeholders encounter only civilizational-scale messaging.

---

## 9. Machine Enforcement Protocol

This charter is editorially enforceable by human review. It must also be machine-enforceable through automated scanning integrated into the publication pipeline. This section defines the deterministic rules for automated compliance.

### 9.1 Domain Keyword Firewall

Each domain maintains a canonical exclusive lexicon. The presence of any exclusive term from the opposing domain constitutes a CRITICAL violation (CR-05) and must block publication.

#### 9.1.1 Industrial Exclusive Lexicon (aircraftmodel.eu only)

| Term | Term | Term |
|------|------|------|
| ATA | CS-25 | LH₂ |
| AMPEL360 | Fuel cell | LC01–LC14 |
| Supply chain | S1000D | DO-178C |
| DO-254 | DO-160 | iSpec 2200 |
| Cryogenic cell | FMEA | Type certificate |
| Airworthiness | MRO | GSE |
| Blended wing body | PEM | CSDB |

#### 9.1.2 Sovereign Exclusive Lexicon (aerospacemodel.com only)

| Term | Term | Term |
|------|------|------|
| Orbital governance | GAIA | Quantum-classical bridge |
| QKD | QSS | Constellation |
| Sovereign coordination | Space diplomacy | ITU |
| CCSDS | NIST Quantum | Quantum navigation |
| Orbital diagrams | Intergovernmental | Planetary-scale |
| Strategic doctrine | Sovereign autonomy | Quantum lattice |
| STANAG | Earth monitoring | Civilizational |

### 9.2 Automated Scan Rules

| Rule | Condition | Result | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| MF-01 | aircraftmodel.eu content contains any Sovereign Exclusive Lexicon term | CRITICAL | Block publish |
| MF-02 | aerospacemodel.com content contains any Industrial Exclusive Lexicon term | CRITICAL | Block publish |
| MF-03 | Cross-domain hyperlink detected in body content or primary navigation | MEDIUM | Flag for review |
| MF-04 | Cross-domain hyperlink detected in footer or "Related Entities" section | PASS | Allowed |
| MF-05 | Visual asset (image/icon/color hex) from opposing domain's palette detected | HIGH | Flag for review |

### 9.3 Integration Points

- **Pre-commit hook:** scan staged content against both lexicons before allowing commit.
- **CI pipeline gate:** automated scan runs on every pull request targeting either domain's repository.
- **CMS plugin:** if a headless CMS is used, integrate the keyword firewall as a validation rule on save/publish.
- **Monthly cron job:** full-text scan of both live domains with report generated and sent to Charter Owner.

### 9.4 Lexicon Maintenance

The exclusive lexicons are living documents. Terms may be added or removed by the Charter Owner with documented rationale. Changes to the lexicons follow the same amendment process as the charter itself and are logged in the amendment log. Lexicon versions are tracked independently with the format `LEX-IND-vN.N` and `LEX-SOV-vN.N`.
