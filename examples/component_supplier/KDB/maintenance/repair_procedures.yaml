        max_corrosion_depth_mm: 0.10
        
      procedure: |
        EVALUATION:
        1. Measure damage depth with profilometer
        2. Determine if within repairable limits
        
        REPAIR (if within limits):
        3. Hone cylinder bore to remove damage
        4. Maximum honing removal: 0.10 mm diameter
        5. Verify surface finish: 0.4 Ra max
        6. Verify bore diameter within tolerance
        7. Install oversize piston seal if required
        
      acceptance:
        bore_diameter_tolerance_mm: "+0.000 / +0.15"
        surface_finish_ra: 0.4
        
    notes: |
      Cylinder bores exceeding repair limits must be replaced.
      Document all repairs in component logbook.

      procedure: |
        EVALUATION:
        1. Inspect rod surface for damage
        2. Measure damage depth
        3. Check runout (max 0.05 mm TIR)
        
        REPAIR (if within limits):
        4. Polish rod surface to remove minor damage
        5. Re-chrome rod if chrome is damaged
        6. Grind to restore diameter
        7. Verify surface finish: 0.2 Ra max
