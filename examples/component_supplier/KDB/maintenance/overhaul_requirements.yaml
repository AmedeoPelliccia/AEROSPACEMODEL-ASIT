        5. Disassemble piston/rod from cylinder
        6. Remove all seals and backup rings
        
        INSPECTION:
        7. Inspect cylinder bore (see inspection criteria)
        8. Inspect piston rod (see inspection criteria)
        9. Inspect rod end bearing bores
        10. Check all threads
        
        REASSEMBLY:
        11. Install new seal kit (mandatory)
        12. Reassemble piston/rod into cylinder
        13. Install rod end bearings
        14. Install position sensor
        15. Perform functional test

        Functional test requirements after overhaul or seal replacement.
        
      procedure: |
        TEST SETUP:
        1. Install actuator in test stand
        2. Connect hydraulic supply (210 bar)
        3. Connect position sensor readout
        
        TESTS:
        4. Extend/retract 5 cycles minimum
        5. Verify full stroke
        6. Check extension force
        7. Check retraction force
        8. Leak test at proof pressure (315 bar)
        9. Verify position sensor output
        
        ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
        - No external leakage
        - Internal leakage < 2 ml/min
        - Force within specification
        - Position sensor accuracy ±1%

        Preservation requirements for overhauled units.
        
      procedure: |
        1. Fill actuator with MIL-PRF-3150 preservative oil
        2. Cycle actuator 3 times
        3. Drain excess preservative
        4. Install protective caps on all ports
        5. Apply corrosion preventive compound to exposed metal
        6. Bag in moisture barrier bag with desiccant
        7. Label with date and next inspection due date
        
      notes: |
        Storage life when properly preserved: 2 years
        Reinspection required at 2-year intervals
