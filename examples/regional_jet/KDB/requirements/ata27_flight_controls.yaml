        The RJ7 flight control system provides primary and secondary
        flight control surfaces for aircraft maneuverability.
        
      details: |
        Primary flight controls:
        - Ailerons (roll control)
        - Elevators (pitch control)
        - Rudder (yaw control)
        
        Secondary flight controls:
        - Flaps (lift augmentation)
        - Spoilers (lift dump, speed brake)
        - Horizontal stabilizer trim
