      summary: |
        The SL2 flight control system is a quadruple-redundant fly-by-wire
        system controlling aircraft attitude through differential rotor
        commands.
        
      details: |
        The FCS provides:
        - Roll control via differential rotor thrust
        - Pitch control via differential forward/aft thrust
        - Yaw control via differential torque
        - Vertical control via collective thrust
        - Transition control (hover to cruise)

      summary: |
        The FCC implements three control law modes.
        
      details: |
        Normal Mode:
        - Full envelope protection
        - Automatic thrust management
        - Transition automation
        
        Alternate Mode (single FCC failure):
        - Reduced envelope protection
        - Manual thrust bias available
        
        Direct Mode (multiple FCC failures):
        - Basic rate damping only
        - No envelope protection
        - Emergency use only
