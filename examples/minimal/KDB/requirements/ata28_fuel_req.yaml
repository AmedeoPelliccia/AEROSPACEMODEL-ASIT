    content:
      summary: |
        The fuel system provides storage, management, and delivery 
        of fuel to the aircraft engines.
        
      details: |
        The fuel system consists of the following major components:
        - Fuel tanks (wing and center)
        - Fuel pumps (boost and transfer)
        - Fuel quantity indication system
        - Fuel distribution manifold
        - Crossfeed and isolation valves
        
      safety_note: |
        All fuel system maintenance must be performed with appropriate
        fire safety precautions in place.

    content:
      summary: |
        The aircraft fuel is stored in integral wing tanks and a
        center fuselage tank.
        
      details: |
        Tank configuration:
        - Left wing tank: 500 gallons
        - Right wing tank: 500 gallons  
        - Center tank: 300 gallons
        - Total capacity: 1,300 gallons

    info_code: "040"
    
    content:
      summary: |
        The fuel distribution system transfers fuel from tanks to
        engines through a manifold system.
        
      details: |
        Distribution features:
        - Boost pumps in each tank
        - Crossfeed capability
        - Engine isolation valves
        - Gravity feed backup
