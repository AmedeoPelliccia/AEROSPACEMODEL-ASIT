      procedure: |
        1. Establish 15m exclusion zone
        2. Position fire extinguisher
        3. Verify no ignition sources in zone
        4. Connect bonding cable (aircraft to GSE)
        5. Connect grounding cable (GSE to ground point)
        6. Verify H2 detection system operational
        7. Brief all personnel on emergency procedures
        8. Verify communication with operations
        
    warnings:
      - type: "hydrogen"
        text: |
          DO NOT commence refueling if any H2 is detected in area.
          Investigate and resolve any leak before proceeding.

      procedure: |
        1. Complete pre-refueling safety check
        2. Open aircraft refueling panel
        3. Connect nitrogen purge line
        4. Purge transfer line with N2
        5. Connect LH2 fill coupling
        6. Verify seal integrity
        7. Begin slow fill (20% rate)
        8. Monitor for leaks continuously
        9. Increase to normal fill rate
        10. Monitor tank level and pressure
        11. Stop fill at target level
        12. Close tank isolation valve
        13. Purge fill line with N2
        14. Disconnect LH2 coupling (cap immediately)
        15. Disconnect N2 purge
        16. Close refueling panel
        17. Disconnect grounding/bonding
        18. Clear exclusion zone
