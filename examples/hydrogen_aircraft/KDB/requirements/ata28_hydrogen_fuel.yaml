        The HJ1 hydrogen fuel system stores and delivers liquid hydrogen
        (LH2) to the fuel cell power system.
        
      details: |
        The hydrogen fuel system consists of:
        - Two cryogenic vacuum-insulated tanks (800 kg total)
        - Hydrogen distribution system
        - Vaporization system (LH2 to GH2)
        - Pressure regulation system
        - Vent and relief system
        - Leak detection system
        - Ground refueling interface

          HYDROGEN IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE. Invisible flame. Wide 
          flammability range (4-75% in air). Ensure proper ventilation
          and leak detection before any maintenance.
