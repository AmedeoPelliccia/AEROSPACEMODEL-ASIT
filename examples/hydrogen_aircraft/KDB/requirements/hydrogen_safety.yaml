        Critical safety information for hydrogen fuel system maintenance.
        
      details: |
        HYDROGEN PROPERTIES:
        - Colorless, odorless gas
        - Extremely flammable (4-75% in air)
        - Invisible flame
        - Very low ignition energy (0.02 mJ)
        - Lighter than air (rises rapidly)
        - Cryogenic liquid at -253°C
        
        HAZARDS:
        - Fire/Explosion: Wide flammability range
        - Asphyxiation: Displaces oxygen in enclosed spaces
        - Cold burns: Cryogenic contact injury
        - Embrittlement: Material damage from H2 exposure
        - Overpressure: Rapid vaporization hazard

      procedure: |
        1. EVACUATE area immediately (upwind)
        2. SOUND alarm / notify emergency services
        3. ELIMINATE ignition sources
        4. DO NOT attempt to stop major leak
        5. ISOLATE hydrogen supply (if safe)
        6. VENTILATE area
        7. DO NOT re-enter until H2 < 1%

          HYDROGEN FLAME IS INVISIBLE. Do not assume no fire if no
          visible flame. Use thermal imaging or broom test.

      procedure: |
        1. EVACUATE area immediately
        2. SOUND alarm / notify fire services
        3. SHUT OFF hydrogen supply (if safe)
        4. ALLOW fire to burn out if supply cannot be stopped
        5. PROTECT surrounding equipment with water spray
        6. DO NOT use CO2 or dry chemical on LH2
        7. DO NOT approach cryogenic fire without full PPE
        
    warnings:
      - type: "fire"
        text: |
          DO NOT attempt to extinguish hydrogen fire unless supply
          can be isolated. Uncontrolled hydrogen release is more
          dangerous than controlled burn.

      procedure: |
        1. EVACUATE area immediately (upwind)
        2. SOUND alarm / notify emergency services
        3. STOP source of spill (if safe)
        4. DO NOT contact liquid or cold surfaces
        5. VENTILATE area (natural preferred)
        6. ALLOW to evaporate naturally
        7. MONITOR for H2 accumulation overhead
        
    warnings:
      - type: "cold-injury"
        text: |
          LH2 causes instant frostbite on contact. Do not touch
          spilled liquid, frost, or cold surfaces. Evaporating
          hydrogen is extremely cold and flammable.
