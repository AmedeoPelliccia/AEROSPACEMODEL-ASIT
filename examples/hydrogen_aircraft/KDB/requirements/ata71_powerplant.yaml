        The fuel cell power system generates electrical power from
        hydrogen and air using PEM fuel cell technology.
        
      details: |
        System architecture:
        - Four PEM fuel cell stacks (625 kW each)
        - Total power output: 2.5 MW
        - Two electric propulsion motors
        - Power conversion and distribution
        
        The fuel cells combine hydrogen fuel with air to produce:
        - Electrical power (DC)
        - Water (product)
        - Heat (waste)
