        The HJ1 electrical power system uses fuel cells as the primary
        power source for both propulsion and aircraft systems.
        
      details: |
        Power architecture:
        - Primary: 4x PEM fuel cell stacks (2.5 MW total)
        - Emergency: Li-ion battery backup (200 kWh)
        - Output: 540 VDC (propulsion), 270 VDC (systems)
        - AC conversion: Inverters for 115/200 VAC loads
