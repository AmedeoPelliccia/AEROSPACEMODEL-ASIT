# Contributing to AEROSPACEMODEL
## CoDevOps – Collective Development & Operational Responsibility

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **AEROSPACEMODEL**.

This project follows a **CoDevOps** model:
- **CoDEv (Collective Development)** establishes legitimacy through shared work.
- **CoOpS (Cooperative Software)** secures governance and value return for contributors.

If you contribute here, you are not donating labor.
You are participating in the construction of a **shared, governed digital asset**.

## 1. What This Project Is (and Is Not)

### This project **IS**:
- Collective by design
- Evidence-driven
- Governed by declared intent
- Aligned with EU principles (transparency, accountability, proportionality)
- Structured to transition toward **Cooperative Software (CoOpS)**

### This project **IS NOT**:
- A vendor-driven open-core project
- A free R&D pipeline for third-party enterprises
- A "contribute now, maybe benefit later" initiative
- A roadmap dictated by external sponsors

There is **no sponsor**.
There is **no hidden beneficiary**.

## 2. CoDevOps Principles

All contributions are governed by the following principles:

1. **Declared Intent**
   - Every contribution must state *why* it exists, not only *what* it does.

2. **Validated Reality**
   - Claims, models, and logic must be grounded in verifiable evidence or explicit assumptions.

3. **Neutrality**
   - Contributions must not embed hidden optimization agendas (commercial, political, or personal).

4. **Traceability**
   - Contributions must be attributable and reviewable.

5. **Human Reassessment**
   - No system, model, or process is assumed infallible.
   - Design must allow human override, review, and rescue.

## 3. What You Can Contribute

Contributions are not limited to code.

We welcome:

- Software code
- Architecture and system design
- Specifications and models
- Documentation and technical writing
- Governance frameworks
- Validation datasets (synthetic or real, when allowed)
- Review, critique, and failure analysis
- Operational practices (DevOps, MLOps, validation flows)

If it improves **clarity, robustness, or legitimacy**, it counts.

---

## 4. Contribution Process

### Step 1 — Declare Intent
Before or with your contribution, clearly state:
- What problem it addresses
- Why it matters to AEROSPACEMODEL's mission
- What assumptions it relies on

This can be done in:
- the pull request description
- a design note
- a linked issue or document

---

### Step 2 — Make a Concrete Contribution
Submit your contribution via:
- Pull Request
- Issue with attached artifacts
- Design proposal (for significant changes)

Small, reviewable contributions are preferred over large opaque ones.

---

### Step 3 — Review and Dialogue
All contributions are reviewed with attention to:
- technical quality
- architectural coherence
- alignment with declared intent
- compliance with CoDevOps principles

Disagreement is expected.
Silence is not.

---

## 5. Recognition and Traceability

Every accepted contribution is:
- recorded
- attributable
- preserved in project history

This traceability is **not symbolic**.
It forms the basis for:
- future governance rights
- cooperative membership
- value-return mechanisms in the CoOpS phase

No contribution is "just volunteer work".

---

## 6. From CoDEv to CoOpS

AEROSPACEMODEL is explicitly designed to transition from **CoDEv** to **CoOpS**.

This transition will occur when:
- collective development criteria are met
- governance structures are validated
- contribution evidence is complete

At that point:
- ownership will be formalized cooperatively
- contributors become members
- value-return mechanisms activate

**Contribution establishes legitimacy.  
Cooperation secures return.**

---

## 7. What Is Not Accepted

Contributions will be rejected if they:
- exist primarily to serve third-party enterprise capture
- obscure assumptions or evidence
- introduce non-transparent dependencies
- bypass governance or review
- pressure maintainers for speed over integrity

This is intentional.

---

## 8. Code of Conduct (Short Version)

- Be precise.
- Be respectful.
- Argue with evidence, not authority.
- Challenge ideas, not people.
- Assume good faith, require clarity.

Serious work requires serious dialogue.

---

## 9. Final Note

> **AEROSPACEMODEL is built for contributors who want to govern what they build and benefit from what they sustain.**

If that aligns with you, welcome.
If not, it is better to know early.

**Thank you for contributing to AEROSPACEMODEL.**
